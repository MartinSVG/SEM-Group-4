Group 4’s Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is designed to support all members of Group 4 in maintaining professional standards with a particular interest in ensuring that the interactions during this project are carried out in a professional and ethical manner. Group 4 is committed to the provision of the highest standard of integrity and quality in its working environment. This handbook provides a useful summary of many of Group 4’s policies and procedures and should serve as a handy source of reference for all group members.

Our code of conduct embodies Group 4’s core values of quality output ethics in all areas of our lives. These values include honesty, integrity, fairness, and teamwork which all aid in building effective relationships and serve as principles that guide our behaviour. Group 4 seeks to ensure that we maintain a good environment that encourages mutual respect, promotes civil and congenial relationships among Team Members and is free from all forms of harassment and violence.

•	Ensure that interaction and relationships with each other must be characterized by honesty, decency, integrity, and fairness.

•	Conduct themselves in a friendly, considerate, respectful, empathetic, patient, and generous way.

•	Agree to work on the Project with the other members.
